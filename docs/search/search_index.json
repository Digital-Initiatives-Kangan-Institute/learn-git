Example: # Switch to an existing branch git switch main # Switch to a newly created branch git switch feature-login 3. git add Purpose: Stages changes in your working directory for the next commit. Example: # Stage a single file git add index.html # Stage all changes git add . 4. git pull Purpose: Fetches and merges changes from a remote repository into your current branch. Example: # Pull changes from the remote 'main' branch git pull origin main 5. git push Purpose: Sends your committed changes to a remote repository. Example: # Push changes to the remote 'main' branch git push origin main 6. git status Purpose: Shows the status of changes in your working directory and staging area. Example: # Check which files are staged, modified, or untracked git status 7. git restore Purpose: Discards changes in the working directory or restores files from the staging area. Example: # Discard changes in a single file git restore index.html # Unstage a file git restore --staged index.html 8. git clone Purpose: Creates a local copy of a remote repository.

One common strategy uses three main branches : Master (or Main) Branch Staging Branch Dev Branch 1. Master Branch Purpose: The \u201cproduction-ready\u201d branch. Only fully tested and stable code goes here. Usage: No direct development on this branch. Only merge code that has passed testing in Staging. 2. Staging Branch Purpose: A testing branch that acts as a \u201cpreview\u201d before code goes live. Usage: Merge completed features from Dev here for testing. QA or testing is performed on this branch. 3. Dev Branch Purpose: The main branch for active development. Usage: Developers create feature branches from Dev. Merge completed features back into Dev when ready. 4. Feature Branches Purpose: Isolate individual features or bug fixes. Usage: Created from Dev. Merged back into Dev when complete. Recommended Workflow Create feature branches from Dev. Develop and commit in feature branches. Merge feature branches into Dev when done. Test Dev branch , then merge Dev into Staging for broader testing. Test Staging , then merge Staging into Master for release. Benefits of This Strategy Keeps production stable. Encourages testing before release. Allows multiple developers to work in parallel safely. Clear separation of development, testing, and production code.","title":"Branching Strategy"},{"location":"pages/branching-strategy/#branching-strategy-guide","text":"When working on a team or even solo, it\u2019s helpful to organize your code with branches so that development is safe, changes are tested, and releases are controlled.

Git is a version control system that helps you track changes to your code over time. It allows you to save snapshots of your work so you can return to an earlier version if needed. It also makes collaboration easier by organising and combining changes from different people. Picture yourself coding and making changes throughout the day. To avoid losing earlier work, you start creating backup copies of your files. Soon, these copies pile up and it becomes hard to keep track of them. Instead, you can use Git to save snapshots of your code as you work. This way, you only need to manage one set of files, and Git keeps track of all the different versions for you automatically. NOTE: Git isn\u2019t the only version control system, there are plenty of others, each with their own purpose. But Git is the best one and the rest suck. Installing Git ...
